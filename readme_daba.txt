My hubot is aimed at helping you decide what t make for a dinner party.
It asks you the number of guests you'll be inviting and your choice of cuisines then suggests a meal option and # of meals to make based on guest size.
I used for loops, conditions, and Math.random to create my robot. The for loop is used to calculate the number of meals to make based on guest size.
I used the conditionals to choose the type of meal based on their preferences. If a user chose french for example, the robot would output a steak.
I used Math.random for users who chose suprise me as a meal option. It would randomly choose the type of cuisine they'd like for their dinner with friends. 


I'm extremely proud of my work and I'm excited to see what else I could build. Best, Daba :)
